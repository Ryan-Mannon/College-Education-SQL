# College-Education-SQL
A project that I worked on with three other people that dove into different databases to determine if college was worth the price, and who it would be worth for.

For our project, we wanted to explore whether attending a university is financially worthwhile given today’s job market—a pressing question for many young adults. To analyze this, we selected three interconnected datasets from a Kaggle project by Jesse Mostipak, which examines college tuition, diversity, and graduate salaries. We chose to obtain our datasets from this project as they were incredibly extensive, providing data for almost three thousand colleges in the United States. The specific datasets we chose were “diversity_school,” “salary_potential,” and “tuition_costs.”
